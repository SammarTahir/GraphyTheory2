Thompson's Construction

This was created by by Ken Thompson

This algorithm turns a regular expression into a nondetermistic finite automaton
	Same computational as interface and regular expressions

Works on fragments of n nfa
	Smaller nfa

	Normal charaters push to the stack
	Special charaters pop from and push to the stack
